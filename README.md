## Whole Foods Healthier Food Cost Analysis

**Project Overview:**

In this project, I aim to answer a critical question: Do healthier foods cost less at Whole Foods? To achieve this, I have conducted an in-depth analysis using SQL, focusing on a single table extracted from Whole Foods' database, which contains structured information relevant to my investigation.

My analysis incorporates the following SQL structures:
- Group by and aggregation for data summarization.
- Subqueries to access relevant data subsets.
- Case statements for conditional calculations.
